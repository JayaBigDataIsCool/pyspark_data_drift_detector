# Hexagonal Architecture Diagram for Data Drift Detector

## Diagram Title: "PySpark Data Drift Detector - Hexagonal Component Architecture"

## Design Instructions:
- Create a hexagon-based architecture with color-coding by function
- Use a central hexagon with surrounding rings of components
- Connect components with arrowed lines showing data/process flow
- Add small icons in each hexagon representing its function

## Component Structure:

### Central Core (Gold Hexagon):
- "Data Drift Detector" - Main orchestration component
- Add tagline: "Comprehensive drift detection for Delta Lake tables"

### Inner Ring (Blue Hexagons - connect directly to core):
1. "Configuration Manager" - Handles config files, thresholds, profiles
   - Icon: Gear/settings
   - Connect to: Core, Column Type Inference, Analysis components

2. "Delta Table Interface" - Manages data loading and time travel 
   - Icon: Database/table
   - Connect to: Core, Column Type Inference

3. "Column Type Inference" - Determines column types for analysis
   - Icon: Columns/categorization
   - Connect to: Core, Analysis components

4. "Schema Evolution Analyzer" - Detects schema changes
   - Icon: Schema/structure
   - Connect to: Core, Results Processor

5. "Results Processor" - Aggregates analysis results
   - Icon: Report/document
   - Connect to: Core, Output components

### Outer Ring (Green Hexagons - connect to appropriate inner components):
1. "Numerical Analysis" - Statistical analysis for numerical columns
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

2. "Categorical Analysis" - Distribution analysis for categorical columns
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

3. "Correlation Analysis" - Detects changes in relationships between columns
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

4. "Group-Level Analysis" - Analyzes drift within categorical segments
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

5. "Distribution Analysis" - Focused on distribution shape, quantiles
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

6. "Rare Event Detection" - Identifies changes in rare categories
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

7. "Feature Importance" - Analyzes predictive power changes
   - Connect to: Column Type Inference, Results Processor

### Output Components (Purple Hexagons - connect to Results Processor):
1. "Drift Assessment" - Summary of detected drift
   - Icon: Gauge/meter

2. "Recommendation Engine" - Actionable next steps
   - Icon: Lightbulb/advice

3. "Historical Tracking" - Storage of results for trend analysis
   - Icon: Timeline/history

## Key Features to Highlight (add callout boxes around the diagram):
1. "Modular Design: Easy to extend with new analyzers"
2. "Comprehensive Analysis: Multiple dimensions of data drift"
3. "Delta Lake Integration: Precise version comparison"
4. "Actionable Insights: Not just detection, but recommendations"
5. "Scalable Architecture: Handles tables with billions of rows"
