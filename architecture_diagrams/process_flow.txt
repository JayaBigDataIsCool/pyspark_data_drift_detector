# Process Flow Architecture Diagram for Data Drift Detector

## Diagram Title: "PySpark Data Drift Detector - Process Flow"

## Design Instructions:
- Create a horizontal flow diagram with 6 sequential stages
- Use distinct colors for each stage (gradient from blue to purple)
- Include connecting arrows between stages (horizontal flow)
- Add small icons for each process step

## Process Stages (left to right):

1. CONFIGURATION & SETUP (Light Blue)
   - Steps: Config File Processing | Threshold Determination | Column Selection | Validation
   - Description: "Initialize system with configuration parameters"
   - Icon: Gear/settings

2. DATA ACQUISITION (Teal Blue)
   - Steps: Reference Data Loading | Current Data Loading | Schema Validation | Sampling
   - Description: "Load data versions from Delta Lake"
   - Icon: Database/table

3. DATA PREPARATION (Green)
   - Steps: Column Type Inference | Schema Drift Analysis | Batch Creation
   - Description: "Analyze metadata and prepare for processing"
   - Icon: Transform/process

4. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS (Yellow-Green)
   - Steps: Statistical Analysis | Distribution Analysis | Correlation Analysis | Group Analysis | Feature Importance
   - Description: "Apply specialized analyzers to detect drift"
   - Icon: Magnifying glass/analysis

5. RESULTS AGGREGATION (Orange)
   - Steps: Drift Detection | Severity Assessment | Result Formatting | Recommendations
   - Description: "Combine results and determine significance"
   - Icon: Combine/aggregate

6. OUTPUT & STORAGE (Purple)
   - Steps: Results Saving | Visualization | Historical Integration
   - Description: "Save results and prepare for presentation"
   - Icon: Save/database

## Key Process Characteristics (add callout boxes):
1. "Parallel Analysis: Multiple analyzers run concurrently"
2. "Adaptive Processing: Analysis depth based on configuration"
3. "Scalable: Batch processing for large datasets"
4. "Error Handling: Graceful recovery from analysis failures"
5. "Delta Lake Integration: Time travel for version comparison"
