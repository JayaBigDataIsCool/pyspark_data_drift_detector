# Layered Architecture Diagram for Data Drift Detector

## Diagram Title: "PySpark Data Drift Detector - Layered Architecture"

## Design Instructions:
- Create a layered architecture with 5 distinct horizontal layers
- Use gradient colors for each layer (suggested: blue to green to orange to purple)
- Include connecting arrows between layers (downward flow)
- Add a small Delta Lake logo near the Data Layer components

## Layer Structure (top to bottom):

1. USER INTERFACE LAYER (Light Blue) 
   - Components: Config Files | Command Line Interface | Jupyter Notebooks | Web Dashboard
   - Description: "Multiple interfaces for configuring and initiating drift detection"

2. ORCHESTRATION LAYER (Teal)
   - Main Component: DataDriftDetector (central, larger box)
   - Sub-components: Configuration Management | Version Control | Adaptive Thresholds | Results Formatter
   - Description: "Central orchestration of the drift detection process"

3. DATA LAYER (Green)
   - Components: DataLoader | Delta Lake Time Travel | Schema Analyzer | Column Analyzer
   - Description: "Data access and preprocessing with Delta Lake time travel capability"

4. ANALYSIS LAYER (Orange)
   - Components (2x4 grid):
     * Row 1: Numerical Analyzer | Categorical Analyzer | Distribution Analyzer | Correlation Analyzer
     * Row 2: Group Analyzer | Rare Event Analyzer | Feature Importance | Outlier Detection
   - Description: "Comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis modules"

5. OUTPUT LAYER (Purple)
   - Components: Drift Assessment & Summary | Recommendations Engine | Historical Results (Delta Tables)
   - Description: "Actionable insights and historical tracking"

## Key Features to Highlight (add callout boxes):
1. "Delta Lake Time Travel for Precise Version Comparison"
2. "Modular Analysis Framework for Easy Extensibility"
3. "Adaptive Thresholds Based on Data Characteristics"
4. "Multi-dimensional Drift Analysis (statistical, distributional, correlational)"
5. "Historical Tracking of Drift Patterns Over Time"
